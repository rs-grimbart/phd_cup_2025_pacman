## Hardware
- PSOCâ„¢ 6 AI Evaluation Kit

Each AI Evaluation Kit has been flashed with our Radar Gesture Recognition Application. We provided an example [code](./main.py) for you to start with. All you need to do now is connect the kit and your laptop with a type C cable using the I/O illustrated below. Then, you should be able to run the example code:
```
## 1. Create a virtual env, the program has been tested with Python 3.7/3.8/3.9/3.10
## 2. Enter your virtual env
## 3. pip install pyserial
## 4. Execute the main.py

## Window
